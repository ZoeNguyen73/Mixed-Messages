## General info
This project is part of **Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path**, which requires us to build a message generator program.

Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.

### Methodology

Every time the Mixed Messages program is run, a message is generated which includes a random adjective, a random noun and a random verb, which are generated from their respective arrays.

Thanks to [*ijmacdowell*](https://gist.github.com/ijmacdowell/8325491) on github for your helpful input arrays.
