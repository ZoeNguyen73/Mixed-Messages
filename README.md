## General info
This project is part of **Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path**, which requires us to build a message generator program.

Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.

## Methodology

Every time the Mixed Messages program is run, a message is generated which includes a random adjective, a random animal and a random verb, which are generated from their respective arrays.
